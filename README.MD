# Arduino SPI Library

SPIdev library for Arduino - Main SPI device class header file

Abstracts bit and byte SPI R/W functions into a convenient class

Based on I2Cdev library by Jeff Rowberg.

It's the same interface as I2Cdev library for SPI.

## Idea based on:

[I2Cdev Library](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib)

[MPU](https://github.com/bolderflight/MPU9250/blob/master/src/MPU9250.cpp)

## TODO Methods:
- readBytes
- readWords
- writeBytes
- writeWords
